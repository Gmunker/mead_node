Being quarantined doesn't mean I have to sit back and watch TV all day. I am a fan of Andrew Meads courses, and when he released this I bought it right away. I have been using Node.js, well I have been fumbling along with Node.js for some time now. I never felt I had the time to sit and focus on the course, now I have no excuse!

You can find the course at:

I highly recommend his teaching style!
